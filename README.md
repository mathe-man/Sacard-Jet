# Sacard Physic Engine - Sacard-Jet
Sacard Physic Engine is small physic engine which can simulate the gravitation of multiple celestial bodies. 
This is a 3D version of the original app: [Sacard-Gline](https://github.com/mathe-man/Sacard-Gline)

I recommentd to use the the original 2D app. It's limited by a 2D world but it have a better documentation.
